With Google's robot cars debuting this week in Pittsburgh, many wonder whether
driverless technology will improve or endanger our lives. The Onion weighs the
pros and cons of self-driving cars:

Pro:
- Can finally spend quality time fiddling with radio knobs

- Cities with poor public transportation given the opportunity to dump the
systemic problem onto Google or whoever

- Frees up drivers to be obscene and aggressive toward each other in all sorts
of new ways

- Massive savings on steering wheel maintenance

- No longer necessary to put life at risk each time you want to adjust the
wrapper on your cheese and bacon melt

- History has proven that new technological advancements never have any
unintended fallout

- Don’t have to do thing you previously had to do

Con:
- Drag races only capable of ending in moderately paced ties

- Parents miss out on cherished tradition of improperly teaching child how to
parallel park

- Not yet confirmed whether they come in blue

- Science fiction writers forced to come up with new lazy shorthand for
futuristic landscape

- Won’t get to threaten truant police officers with six weeks of traffic duty
anymore

- Majority of Beach Boys catalog now irrelevant

- Someone definitely going to hack these things
